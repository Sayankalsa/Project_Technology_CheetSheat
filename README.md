# Legal AI Chatbot for New Lawyers: A Smart Application for Legal Document Analysis
### Abstract
This paper presents a smart chatbot application designed to assist
new lawyers with various legal issues. The system utilizes machine
learning algorithms, particularly BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Rep-
resentations from Transformers), to process and analyze legal doc-
uments. By collecting data from various sources and implementing
effective training methodologies, the proposed system can efficiently
identify legal document types and provide relevant information to
users. The system architecture, implementation details, and evalu-
ation metrics are discussed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed solution in addressing the challenges faced by new legal prac-titioners.

### Introduction
The legal profession involves dealing with complex documents and information that can be overwhelming for new practitioners. With the advancement of artificial intelligence and natural language processing technologies, there is a significant opportunity to develop intelligent systems that can assist lawyers in navigating legal documents efficiently. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of existing systems and proposes a novel approach using
AI chatbot applications and machine learning algorithms to help predict legaldocument types and provide relevant information to new lawyers.
