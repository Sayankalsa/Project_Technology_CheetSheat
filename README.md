# Legal AI Chatbot for New Lawyers: A Smart Application for Legal Document Analysis
### Abstract
This paper presents a smart chatbot application designed to assist
new lawyers with various legal issues. The system utilizes machine
learning algorithms, particularly BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Rep-
resentations from Transformers), to process and analyze legal doc-
uments. By collecting data from various sources and implementing
effective training methodologies, the proposed system can efficiently
identify legal document types and provide relevant information to
users. The system architecture, implementation details, and evalu-
ation metrics are discussed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed solution in addressing the challenges faced by new legal prac-titioners.

### Introduction
The legal profession involves dealing with complex documents and information that can be overwhelming for new practitioners. With the advancement of artificial intelligence and natural language processing technologies, there is a significant opportunity to develop intelligent systems that can assist lawyers in navigating legal documents efficiently. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of existing systems and proposes a novel approach using
AI chatbot applications and machine learning algorithms to help predict legaldocument types and provide relevant information to new lawyers.
 - Critiquing-based Recommendation Chatbots
   The research on critiquing-based recommendation chatbots highlights limitations in validation scope, as it only addresses the music recommendation domain. While the results demonstrate efficient criticizing processes, the absence of verification in broader recommendation scenarios may impede the application of the proposed methods in legal domains.
- Microservices Migration Challenges
  The FX Core system case study emphasizes the challenges associated with closely coupled services and the use of various communication paradigms in microservices migration. This complexity may restrict the scalability and efficiency improvements that microservices architecture can provide, which is relevant to building robust legal AI systems.
- Deep Networks for Rule Learning
  Research using deep networks underscores the difficulty of teaching sub-symbolic systems to recognize valid moves in rule-based games like Nine Menâ€™s Morris. This illustrates the inherent challenge of learning intricate rule-based systems from scratch, which is particularly relevant for legal AI systems that must understand complex legal rules and precedents.
- ### Legal Professional Privilege Protection
  Maintaining the integrity of Legal Professional Privilege (LPP) material in digital settings presents significant challenges, especially when copying digital data into storage media images. This highlights the necessity for robust solutions to effectively protect sensitive legal data in AI-powered systems.
