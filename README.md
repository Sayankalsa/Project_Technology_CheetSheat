# Legal AI Chatbot for New Lawyers: A Smart Application for Legal Document Analysis
## Abstract
This paper presents a smart chatbot application designed to assist
new lawyers with various legal issues. The system utilizes machine
learning algorithms, particularly BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Rep-
resentations from Transformers), to process and analyze legal doc-
uments. By collecting data from various sources and implementing
effective training methodologies, the proposed system can efficiently
identify legal document types and provide relevant information to
users. The system architecture, implementation details, and evalu-
ation metrics are discussed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed solution in addressing the challenges faced by new legal prac-titioners.

## Introduction
The legal profession involves dealing with complex documents and information that can be overwhelming for new practitioners. With the advancement of artificial intelligence and natural language processing technologies, there is a significant opportunity to develop intelligent systems that can assist lawyers in navigating legal documents efficiently. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of existing systems and proposes a novel approach using
AI chatbot applications and machine learning algorithms to help predict legaldocument types and provide relevant information to new lawyers.
 - ### Critiquing-based Recommendation Chatbots
   The research on critiquing-based recommendation chatbots highlights limitations in validation scope, as it only addresses the music recommendation domain. While the results demonstrate efficient criticizing processes, the absence of verification in broader recommendation scenarios may impede the application of the proposed methods in legal domains.
- ### Microservices Migration Challenges
  The FX Core system case study emphasizes the challenges associated with closely coupled services and the use of various communication paradigms in microservices migration. This complexity may restrict the scalability and efficiency improvements that microservices architecture can provide, which is relevant to building robust legal AI systems.
- ### Deep Networks for Rule Learning
  Research using deep networks underscores the difficulty of teaching sub-symbolic systems to recognize valid moves in rule-based games like Nine Men’s Morris. This illustrates the inherent challenge of learning intricate rule-based systems from scratch, which is particularly relevant for legal AI systems that must understand complex legal rules and precedents.
- ### Legal Professional Privilege Protection
  Maintaining the integrity of Legal Professional Privilege (LPP) material in digital settings presents significant challenges, especially when copying digital data into storage media images. This highlights the necessity for robust solutions to effectively protect sensitive legal data in AI-powered systems.
- ### Anonymous Fingerprinting Systems
  Anonymous fingerprinting systems for multimedia transfer have advanced, but many current methods have practical limitations. The recombined fingerprint solution involves complex graph searches for traitor tracing, requiring involvement of other purchasers and honest proxies in P2P distribution scenarios.
- ### Maximally Permissive Supervisors
  Creating maximally permissive supervisors for partially seen discrete event systems presents challenges in ensuring safety, non-blockingness, and maximally permissive control. While new algorithms offer promising solutions, discovering subsystems within the complete controller remains computationally challenging due to its complexity.
## Proposed System
- ### Existing System
  Dialogue-based conversational recommender systems (DCRSs) represent a recent development in recommender systems, enabling users to communicate with the system in natural language. This facilitates faster feedback provision and product exploration. However, limited research has been conducted to objectively examine user interaction and perception of these systems, particularly regarding feedback on received recommendations.
 Previous work implemented three prototype systems, each proposing different critique methods: user-initiated, progressive system-suggested, and cascade system-suggested. User studies involving 292 participants evaluated these prototypes through two task-oriented tests: the basic recommendation task (BRT) and the exploration-oriented task (EOT).
 Results indicated that BRT increases user satisfaction while EOT encourages greater user engagement. The types of criticizing approaches used during EOT likely affect user perception and alter associations between interaction metrics and perceived serendipity. These findings suggest useful methods for providing feedback to enhance user-chatbot interaction in recommendation scenarios.
- ### Disadvantages of Existing System
  1. Users’ personalized recommendations heavily depend on specific tastes, potentially resulting in a more constrained exploration environment.
  2. Validation was limited to the music recommendation domain, requiring additional validation in other domains including legal applications.
- ### Proposed System
  The proposed system offers effective solutions for more efficient estimation of legal information through a smart chatbot application designed to assist new lawyers with various legal issues. Data collected from different sources undergoes processing using established methods. Machine learning algorithms, particularly BERT, are utilized to train the dataset.
  The chatbot application can identify legal documents when provided with all the answers required for the estimation process. This project will help predict the type of law relevant to specific cases, enhancing the efficiency of legal practice for new lawyers through chatbot applications and machine learning algorithms.
- ### Advantages of Proposed System
  1. Provides effective solutions on legal documents for incoming lawyers.
  2. Utilizes chatbot applications and machine learning algorithms for easy prediction.
  3. User-friendly interface designed specifically for new lawyers.
## System Architecture
The system architecture consists of several interconnected components designed to facilitate efficient processing and analysis of legal documents. The architecture incorporates data collection, preprocessing, machine learning model training, and user interface components to provide a comprehensive solution for legal document analysis.
## Working Methodology
The project involves developing an Artificial Intelligence Chatbot application for experts on new laws to help solve legal problems. The methodology includes:
   1. Collecting datasets from various sources
   2. Separating data into working files and test data
   3. Preprocessing the dataset using prefix tools
   4. Training the model using advanced ML algorithms (BERT)
   5. Using the trained model to evaluate and predict legal document types.
 BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representation of Transformers) is a deep learning model where each result is placed between every input point and connected to every other input point. Weights are calculated based on possible measurements from connections. After training with the machine learning algorithm, the system can effectively evaluate datasets and determine the correct data type when all answers are provided to the prediction process.

Data collection is a critical component of the project, as increasing the dataset size generally improves accuracy. The collected data consists of written legal documents from various sources. Machine learning has become the preferred method for solving many challenging problems, and in prediction work, it offers superior performance.
 The data collection process involves three steps aligned with the types of machine learning tasks:
